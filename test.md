Opportunity Set 3 – Stakeholder Needs and System Value

Out Date: Wednesday, October 11th, 2023
Due Date: Wednesday October 25th, 2023 10am

This assignment is completed in 2 parts:
1)	Part A will be completed by your Fall 2023 H2 team 
2)	Part B is an individual assignment

Intents
•	Gain experience defining stakeholder needs, including:
o	Distilling user needs from a variety of information sources, including documents and interviews
o	Synthesizing workable user needs from interview data
•	Learn to develop and prioritize stakeholder needs
•	Define quantitative measures of system value delivery
•	Develop use cases to illustrate how stakeholder needs are met

SDM Learning Objectives Addressed: 
•	SA05: Identify and prioritize the stakeholders of the system quantitatively and qualitatively, and elicit and prioritize their needs.
•	SE02: Elicit, define and, formally articulate system value to help guide system priorities and structure value-generating activities across the system lifecycle
•	SE03: Analyze, understand, and represent system behavior by defining and analyzing system missions, operations, modes, and use cases

Context 
You and your H2 team work at Systems Design Masters (SDM) – a prestigious analysis group that solves large-scale systems problems. Your team is developing a vision for the future of surface mobility in the MIT campus and greater Kendall Square innovation district . This is part of your firm’s business development efforts – you don’t currently have a defined sponsor, but the target client(s) are MIT and possibly affiliated organizations with an interest in mobility in the MIT campus and greater Kendall Square innovation district.

You have done some preliminary investigation and determined that you will need to consider: 
•	Utility – Your future vision will produce benefits beyond current transportation offerings (e.g., the system will address most day-to-day needs of a diverse set of stakeholders)
•	Safety – You will address on-going concerns about various aspects of safety (personal, health, public) to inspire confidence in this new approach to surface mobility
•	Sustainability – Your future vision should be emissions-free at point of use as soon as feasible and significantly reduce the overall emissions associated with surface mobility in the area
•	Autonomy – You should explore the use of autonomous technologies for potential beneficial impact on utility and to make a bold statement about the future-embracing orientation of the area
•	Strategic Orientation – Your proposal should align with the region’s growth strategy including promoting Kendall Square as “the new entrance of MIT” and enhancing the area as an innovation ecosystem

Before you start exploring solutions, however, you will need to identify and prioritize stakeholder needs, develop metrics, and define likely use cases. 

A separate group interviewed various stakeholders relevant to the Kendall Square mobility system. They created transcripts from each interview, and these transcripts have been made available to you for your analysis. As a source of information about stakeholder needs, they are limited to the sample of stakeholders who participated in that study, which was conducted within the last 3-4 years. The stakeholders represented in the interviews may or may not represent the complete group of potential stakeholders in this system. Because the references in the interviews are a bit dated, you should seek any publicly available studies, reports, documents, or even additional interviews where possible that can provide additional context and supporting information for your analysis.

Part A – Completed by your H2 team (50% of total OS grade)

1.	Define the mission and goals for a future surface mobility system in the Kendall Square innovation district. This includes the problem(s)/opportunity(ies) to be addressed, the potential resulting value from addressing them, and why action to resolve the problem is necessary. Describe the context for the mobility system in the area of interest. This might include a description of how you define the Kendall Square innovation district and its evolution (past, present, and perhaps projections into the future), the population, economic drivers and trends, what happens during a typical period of interest, and the existing mobility solutions. (up to 2 pages of text and figures). (15%)

2.	Identify the relevant stakeholders/beneficiaries for the transportation system, and their needs. What does the stakeholder need from the system? What does the system need from the stakeholder? How well is the need currently being met? Present your findings in table format, as in the example of a restaurant below, framing “needs” within a context of outputs and value exchange. The reader should be able to quickly understand the magnitude and relative ranking between the needs. (1 page) (15%)

Stakeholder/Beneficiary Category	Their potential output that would meet our needs	Our potential output that would meet their needs	Degree to which the need is currently met	Source(s)
Example: Walk-in customer	Payment for food, tips and 
positive word-of-mouth	Healthy, nutritious meal and quick service in a clean, hygienic environment.	Low. Only 1-2 options currently available, and they are often crowded during peak times	Street interviews,  survey of restaurants in area

3.	Prioritize the stakeholder/beneficiary needs using analysis of your choice. Explain how you decided how the needs should be prioritized (i.e., what criteria, system, method, etc. did you use? How did you ensure that your approach was consistent and rigorous? Do these top needs trace back to the system goals?). (1 page) (10%)

4.	For the top five stakeholder/beneficiary needs for the Kendall Square surface mobility system, identify metrics to quantify success and provide a description and the units of the measure. What information would you need to collect to set targets/objective levels for each of these metrics? (0.5 page). (10%)

Part 2 – Individual assignment (50% of total OS grade)

5.	Based on what you learned about the system mission, context, and user needs, define 3 system scenarios. The scenarios description could include the activity with steps in sequence, capabilities/systems employed, timeline, diagrams or maps, or other materials that provide information to help derive system functions and requirements in later analyses. Be sure the scenarios you describe are differentiated from one another in substantive ways (e.g., based on different users’ needs, measures of performance or effectiveness, operations, capabilities etc.) (no more than 2 pages of text and figures) (25%)

6.	Reflect on your team and individual analysis of a future Kendall Square innovation district transportation system. What is your level of confidence (or conversely, uncertainty) in your understanding of the user needs? Would you feel confident to make commitments about system requirements and concepts based on the stakeholder needs as you’ve currently defined them? Assume that you just received approval for a follow-on study with additional time to focus on developing this system concept. Develop a list of objectives and tasks that you would recommend executing to help you to more accurately define the system, stakeholders, needs, operations, etc. to increase confidence in your recommendations. Assume that the resources available for this follow-on study are not large, so prioritize the next steps and focus primarily on the additional work that will be of greatest benefit to the decision-makers who receive your recommendations (up to 1 page) (25%)
 
Evaluation Criteria (a summary of grading rubric)
Your team response to OS3 will be graded using the following criteria: 

Q1: We are looking for a description of the potential operating environment for the surface transportation system using sourced evidence. We expect a clear definition of the system and its boundaries, including the system mission statement. We are looking for a measure of the scope and/or value of the problem to the stakeholders.

Q2: We are looking for clearly defined stakeholder categories that represent a spectrum of stakeholders.  We expect clear articulation of inputs, outputs, and the degree to which the need is met. 

Q3: We are looking for the correct use of some formal method to quantify/prioritize the stakeholder/beneficiary need, with a logical explanation of the rationale for selecting that method. We are looking for the needs to be clearly prioritized indicating priority order. 

Q4: We are looking for 5 system-level metrics with a clear description of each metric and the way in which it could be measured, including the information needed to set targets/objective levels for each measure.

Your individual response to OS3 will be graded using the following criteria: 
 
Q5: We are looking for three differentiated scenarios that reflect a spectrum of key stakeholders, different modes, and potentially requiring different capabilities.  We expect clear evidence for why the scenarios are different from one another.

Q6: We are looking for evidence that you understand the strengths and limitations inherent in the data sources included in this analysis, as well as a path toward collecting additional information to reflect a representative sample of system stakeholders/users or other relevant information (if you deem it necessary). We are looking for your reflections on the kinds of information and analysis products you think will be most beneficial to decision makers contemplating change in a complex sociotechnical system (comprising both social and technical elements) such as this.
